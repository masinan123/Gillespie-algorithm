# Introduction

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax
for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on
using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. We analysis the data in R(@citeR).

The rest of this project is as follows. In Section 2, we review some
basic concepts. In Section 3, we introduce the topic. In Section 4, we
have an application and simualtion. Section 5 provides conclusion and
some closing remarks.

# Review of the Topic

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that
includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code
chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars,comment=NA}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed publication quality plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

## Definitions and Examples

Such as importance of longitudinal data analysis (separate age and
cohort effect like in the effect of age on reading ability), different
correlation structures, missing data, etc.

## Details of the topic

This is a mathematical formua without formula number.
$$h(x) = \frac{f(x)}{S(x)} = -\frac{d \log[S(x])}{\rm dx}$$

This is how write a fomula and label it. \begin{align}
\label{eq2}
S(x) = \exp[-H(x)] = \exp[-\int_0^x h(u) {\rm d}u]
\end{align}

# Application
    We can simulate the dimerization of DNA pyrimidines, a molecular reaction which can lead to skin cancer. Bipyrimidine photodimerization occurs when UV radiation alters the chemical bonds of two consecutive pyrimidine bases, with two possible outcomes: the formation of the cyclobutene pyrimidine dimer (CPD) if a cycloaddition between the C5-C6 double bond of the pyrimidines occurs, or the formation of pyrimidine (6-4) pyrimidone (64-PP) if  a covalent bond forms between C4 and C6 of the pyrimidines (@MartinezFernandez2022).
    
  Therefore, this simulation involves 4 species and 3 reactions channels: pyrimidine monomers Thymine 1 (T1), Thymine 2 (T2), and dimer photoproducts CPD and 64-PP. 

  We will simulate the dimerization of thymine using propensity based on the formation yield of CPD (~37 per 10^6 normal bases) and 64-PP (~2 per 10^6 normal bases) found by exposing skin cells to a UVB dose of 0.2 J/cm^2 (@Mouret2006). As the amount of thymine bases in DNA varies from person to person, we will simulate thymine photodimerization of 1000 pairs of thymine.
